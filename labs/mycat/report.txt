The difference between my implementation and the local cat Linux implementation is that the local implementation is faster because:
My implementation uses normal system calls to read, open, write and close files, making it to send the system call to the kernel
so it has to wait for the CPU to make usage of the resources.
While the local implementation is completely optimized for the system and make the changes faster, also it is better because
it has code for all the exceptions that maybe my implementation couldn't take care of.
