Lab - Generic Merge Sort
========================
On this lab you will be creating a [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) based program for sorting either strings or integers.

As a guide, take a look in the Quick Sort example from the [C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) book
on **Section 5.11 - Pointers to Functions**.
